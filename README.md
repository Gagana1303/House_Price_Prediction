# 🏡 ExploreHomes – Bangalore House Price Prediction (XGBoost + Flask + Frontend)

ExploreHomes is a complete **end-to-end real estate price prediction platform** that estimates Bangalore house prices using a trained **XGBoost Machine Learning model**.  
The project includes:

- A trained ML pipeline (XGBoost + OneHotEncoder + StandardScaler)
- Flask backend API for prediction
- Fully designed frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Real-time price estimation UI
- Sample listings, hero slider, search filter, and more

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **Frontend**
- Modern and clean UI design  
- Hero image slider  
- Real-estate sample cards  
- Search and filter built-in  
- Price prediction page with:
  - Location input
  - Sqft, BHK, Bathroom fields  
  - AI price estimation  
  - Similar property comparison  
- Mobile responsive layout  

### ✅ **Backend**
- Flask-based REST API (`/api/predict`)
- Loads trained XGBoost pipeline
- Cleans and normalizes locations before prediction
- Handles unknown locations gracefully (“Other” category)

### ✅ **Machine Learning**
- XGBoost Regression Model (R² ≈ 0.82)
- Automatic preprocessing pipeline:
  - OneHotEncoding for location
  - StandardScaler for numeric fields
  - Custom location cleaning
- Outlier handling and feature engineering

## 🧠 How the ML Model Works

The model is trained using the Bangalore House Dataset.  
The pipeline includes:

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Convert sqft ranges
  - Extract BHK from description
  - Remove unrealistic sqft/BHK ratios
  - Price per sqft analysis
  - Location grouping (rare → “Other”)

- **Encoding**
  - OneHotEncoder for 120+ Bangalore locations  
  - Unknown locations mapped to “Other”

- **Model**
  - XGBoost Regressor  
  - Tuned hyperparameters  
  - ~82% prediction accuracy
